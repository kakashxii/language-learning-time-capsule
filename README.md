#  Language Learning Time Capsule

**Description:**
The "Language Learning Time Capsule" is a web application designed to help language learners track their progress and witness their linguistic development over time. Users can input sentences or short texts in different languages that they are currently learning. These sentences are stored in a virtual "time capsule." The unique feature of this project is that users can retrieve and review their stored sentences after a predetermined period, such as a month, a quarter, or a year, to observe how far they have come in their language learning journey.

**Features:**

- User-friendly interface for entering sentences in various languages.
- Dropdown menu for language selection when entering sentences.
- "Submit" button to save the sentence in the time capsule.
- Backend database to store sentences along with creation dates and selected languages.
- Automated retrieval of stored sentences after a specified time period.
- Dedicated page to display retrieved sentences along with original and translated versions (if available).
- Optional user profiles for tracking progress over time.
- Integration of translation functionality to display sentences in different languages.
